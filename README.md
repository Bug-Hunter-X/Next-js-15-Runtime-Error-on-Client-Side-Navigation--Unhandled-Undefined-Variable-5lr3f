# Next.js 15 Runtime Error: Unhandled Undefined Variable

This repository demonstrates a runtime error in a Next.js 15 application that occurs during client-side navigation.  The error stems from attempting to access an undefined variable within a component.

## The Problem

The `about.js` component attempts to access a variable (`something.someProperty`) that is not defined. This causes a runtime error in the browser, specifically during client-side navigation to the `/about` route.  Next.js's default error handling doesn't gracefully catch this error.

## Solution

The solution involves adding error handling using a `try...catch` block or conditional checks to prevent access to the undefined variable.  The improved `about.js` in this repository demonstrates the solution. 

## Reproduction Steps
1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
4. Run `npm run dev` to start the Next.js development server.
5. Navigate to the `/about` page.  You should initially encounter the runtime error.
6. After implementing the fix, the application will handle the undefined variable gracefully.
